
=== This is nginx for Windows, an event driven, non-blocking high performance full
featured webserver based on nginx.

SPDY, multiple workers, ASLR and DEP compliant, embedded WAF, embedded Lua are just
a few features to mention. ===


Note: Should you need support or report anything please use the nginx forums at
http://forum.nginx.org/ or post an issue at https://forums.ecsystems.nl/ or by email
support@ecsystems.nl (where we maintain the package builds)

CVE: any security issues such as vulnerabilities should be reported by email
support@ecsystems.nl (start the subject line with "CVE:"), a security engineer
ticket will be created and dealt with a.s.a.p.

Builds can be found here:
  http://nginx-win.ecsds.eu/
  Follow releases https://twitter.com/nginx4Windows

Todo:
- ldap / ntlm
- allow multiple instances to run on the same machine
- More non-blocking Lua, event based DLL add-on’s like pagespeed, SharePoint, asp/dotnet.
- Full 64 bit builds.
- IO event and thread separation (50% completed).
- Distributed IO and CPU event processing (we have a working proto type).

Feature list (* nginx_basic only):
=* All current nginx features (see with nginx.exe -V) (subject to Windows compatibility)
=* Consistent with original nginx code (subject to Windows compatibility)
=* FD_SETSIZE = 32768 (modded kernel), allows one worker to handle c250k+
   (with optimization registry file)
=* Multiple workers supported ! use no more than 2 workers for 1 core (cpu)
=* SPDY 3.1
=  LuaJIT compiled in (lua-nginx-module)
=  Streaming with nginx-rtmp-module
=  Naxsi WAF - Web Application Firewall
=  Array-var-nginx-module
=  HttpSubsModule
=  echo-nginx-module
=  ngx_http_lower_upper_case
=  headers-more-nginx-module
=  set-misc-nginx-module
=  ngx_http_auth_ldap (experimental)
=* Additional custom 503 error handler via 513
=  lua-upstream-nginx-module (Manipulate upstream dynamically)
=* Select-boost
=* Fully ASLR and DEP compliant for shared memory
=  encrypted-session-nginx-module
=  Nginx-limit-traffic-rate-module
=  RDNS (reverse DNS lookup for incoming connection)
=  AJP - tomcat backend support
=  form-input-nginx-module
=  ngxLuaDB, the drizzle and dynamic loaded module solution
=  ngx_upstream_jdomain
=  cache_purge
=  nginx-http-concat
=  nginx-module-vts (Virtual host traffic status)
Commercial subscription only modules:
=  nginx-vod-module (On-the-fly repackaging of MP4 files to DASH, HDS, HLS, MSS)
These native builds run on Windows XP SP3 and higher, both 32 and 64 bit.


*** Default installation instructions;
* New: unzip this version with folder structure
* Old: overwrite with this version
* Check nginx.conf, nginx-org.conf and nginx-win.conf
* Windows optimization registry file: check your current values BEFORE setting the new ones

*** Integrated installation instructions;
We have thought about building an installer but it seems far easier to lean on existing
combined packages which have nginx for Windows included, mind you these packages use
the official (limited) windows build by nginx but it is extremely easy to replace nginx.exe
with our version. For the most easiest replacement overwrite nginx.exe with nginx_basic.exe
from our package. If you want Lua and all the other advanced functions overwrite nginx.exe
with nginx.exe, place lua51.dll in the same folder as nginx.exe from our package and don't
forget to install vcredist_x86.exe or vcredist_x64.exe.
Example integrated packages are:
http://wtriple.com/wtnmp/
http://wpn-xm.org/
http://winginx.com/en/
A word of warning: keep in mind that integrated packages need to be kept up to date, that
means php, mysql, etc. all need to be upgraded whenever possible.
*** Anyway, we've made something :) see Install_nginx_php_services.zip on site.

+ Additional custom 503 error handler via 513 (see onsite readme for example)
  Issue: a "return 503" can only be used once in a location block, when a custom 503
         is used for example with limit_req_zone you can't have a second custom 503
	 for a maintenance page
  example:
    server {
        listen  80;
        server_name  www.any.nl;
        root    '/webroot/www.any.nl';
        error_page 503 @floodnotice;
        error_page 513 @maintenance;
        location / {
            if (-f $document_root/maintenance_mode.html) { return 513; }
            # Or with a local IP check
            ## Note: there is a bug with this last IF, see http://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,251650
            ## for more info about this incorrect behavior (dd. 12-7-2014)
            # set $maintmode S; if ($remote_addr ~ "^(10.10.*.*)$") { set $maintmode L; }
            # if (-f $document_root/maintenance_mode.html) { set $maintmode "${maintmode}M"; }
            # if ($maintmode = SM) { return 513; }
            # Yes we all know by now, ifisevil so put a sock in it
            # Or with pure Lua, no IF issues
            ## rewrite_by_lua '
            ##   local s = 0; local v = 0;
            ##   local source_fname = ngx.var.document_root .. "/maintenance_mode.html";
            ##   local file = io.open(source_fname);
            ##   if file then v=1; file:close(); end;
            ##   if string.find(ngx.var.remote_addr, "^10.10.30.") then v=0; end;
            ##   if v>0 then return ngx.exit(513); end;
            ## ';
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
            index  index.html index.htm;
            limit_req zone=floodh burst=32 nodelay;
            # generates a 503 when triggered
            # see limit_req_zone directive how limit_req works
        }
        location @floodnotice {
            root html
            rewrite ^ /floodnotice.html break;
        }
        location @maintenance {
            rewrite ^ /maintenance_mode.html break;
            # process a 513 but return a 503 to client !
        }
    }
  The normal behavior would be (if the file exists) to return the contents 
  of "/maintenance_mode.html" with a "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", or when the 503 error_page
  is used a 503, however a 503 is often used for other things, With this new 513
  error_page the same thing can be done but the 513 is replaced with a 503 when
  the headers are compiled which allows you to use the real 503 for other things
+ Select-boost: event driven, non-blocking API select() replacement, Beta
  No need to enable anything, it is fully automatic and won't be used if certain
  conditions do not pass internal tests
